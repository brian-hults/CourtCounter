# CourtCounter Android App

A basketball score-keeping app that allows the user to click different score values and a foul button, 
and keeps track of both teams scores and foul counts. Once the team foul count reaches 10, 'Bonus +' is 
shown instead of the foul count. Clicking the 'Reset' button clears all scores and foul counts.
